Hey, there! üê∏ I'm happy to go by Andrew --(he/him)--, Andr√©s --(√©l)--, Andr√© --(il ; ele)--, Anders --(han/honom)--, or anything of the sort. I call [Baltimore, Maryland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore), home.

Perhaps imprudently‚ÄîI was handed a laptop when I turned eight. I've been coding, tinkering, and practically devouring the internet ever since. These days, you'll also find me:

-   Tending to my houseplants.
-   Working on DIY tech projects (like this website).
-   Listening to [alt/indie pop and jazz](https://open.spotify.com/user/we22t37uzwvcm3g6g8d3pxujp?si=776da9aba8244166) on repeat.
-   Combing through scientific research.
-   Forgetting my ADHD medication.

I earned a college certificate in mechanical engineering design technology --(El Camino College)-- and a B.S. in systems engineering --(Johns Hopkins University)--; I do public transit administration by day.
